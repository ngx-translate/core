## Angular 16, 17, 18, 19+

The new [documentation](https://ngx-translate.org/) now covers installation on
Angular 16+ and is divided into smaller, more readable sections, making it
easier to digest than this big README. It also documents the additional
interfaces and explains how to develop custom plugins.

- [Full documentation](https://ngx-translate.org)
- [Migration guide v16 -> v17](https://ngx-translate.org/getting-started/migration-guide/)

## Support

We only support the current version with new updates and fixes.

When using an EOL (End Of Lifetime) version, you have a few options:

- **Upgrade** to the current version of Ngx-translate. We have worked hard to make upgrading simple. You can view our migration guide to assist you in your upgrade.

- **Remain Out of Date**: Continue using the outdated version, but be aware that you will be subject to security risks and bugs.

- **Commercial Support** for EOL versions Our partner [HeroDevs](https://www.herodevs.com/support/nes-angular?utm_source=ngx-translate&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=angular_support_link&utm_id=NgxTranslateReferral) offers commercial security support for EOL versions of Ngx-translate.
